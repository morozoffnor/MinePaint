# MinePaint (I didn't come up with a better name)

This is a plugin for my private Minecraft server. You can draw on the canvas using colored wool, that's all.
Pretty much all the things are hardcoded because I don't think I would change anything in foreseen future. Oh, and this could be like a part of my portfolio.

 #### [Latest Release](https://github.com/morozoffnor/MinePaint/releases/tag/v1.0) is right here
 but I think you should fork repo and change variables to your liking if you wish to use it.
