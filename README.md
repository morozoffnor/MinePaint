# MinePaint (I didn't come up with a better name)

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/420e30b986a246cfae85e8edc8ba3b0d)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/morozoffnor/MinePaint?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=morozoffnor/MinePaint&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

This is a plugin for my private Minecraft server. You can draw on the canvas using colored wool, that's all.
Pretty much all the things are hardcoded because I don't think I would change anything in foreseen future. Oh, and this could be like a part of my portfolio.

 #### [Latest Release](https://github.com/morozoffnor/MinePaint/releases/tag/v1.0) is right here
 but I think you should fork repo and change variables to your liking if you wish to use it.
